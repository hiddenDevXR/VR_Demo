# VR_Demo

Small VR prototype I did a while back in Unity. I use it to show my game dev students how easy and fast is to prototype an idea using the right tools.
It uses Unity's VR framework so the project should be agnostic to any plataform, however, the project was develop with Oculus Quest in mind.
The demo includes score sytem, shader graph materials, audio events, and randomized generation of the targets. 
It's basically a gallery shooter. It still need a lot polishing but it works as a template.
I'll try to updated it and improve on my free time during the next months.

Target platform was Quest 2.
